# Hej, hao's going? 👋 

Jokes aside, I’m **Hao**—an Electronics Engineer and **AI Champion** currently exploring how AI can make an engineer's life easier.

### 🛠️ Technical Background
I’ve spent a lot of time "in the trenches" developing:
* ⚡ **Electronic Speed Control (ESC)**
* 🔋 **Battery Management Systems (BMS)**
* 📡 **BLE Communication & Hand Controls**

### 🤖 The "Hao-to" Mission
I’m treating this space as a "what if" experiment: revisiting complex hardware problems from my past and re-architecting them using the **AI tools** I have now. My goal is to bridge the gap between traditional electronics and efficient AI workflows.
